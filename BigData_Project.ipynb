I will always appreciate a film that shows a demographic that doesn't get much mainstream representation. It is a beautifully made film with some of the best use of colour and cinematography of any film last year. However, I felt that the technique of skipping ahead to different stages in Chiron’s life while interesting meant missing out on his development and results in a lack of connection to the character and dulled the plot. I thought that the beauty of this film both in its message and aesthetic made it deserving of the Best Picture win although I was sure that La La Land was going to take it and I was rooting for Manchester by the Sea or Hell or High Water.

              " \"\\n\\n            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\\n        \\nI'm pretty surprised by how positive this movie has been reviewed.  Many of the character relationships make little to no sense based on what is occurring in the movie.  This is a dark coming of age tale, but loses much of it's believability early on in the movie.  To start, the bullies of the movie recognize the main character as gay long before he himself does, almost making it seem as though because they call him gay he then turns gay. It is hard to care overmuch about the main character as he has maybe 25 lines in the entire movie, and anytime he does talk it's 4-5 word sentences followed by long stretches of silence. I guess this was supposed to be an interesting character trait, but when the movie contains nothing but dialog and the main character doesn't talk it seems like a bit of a problem. It's exacerbated by the fact that every other character in the movie constantly points it out. The best friend/lover is equally confusing throughout the movie.  His sexuality is seemingly fluid ranging from dude bro misogyny to handjibbers at the beach.  At least the friend/lover was charismatic and for me the only redeeming actor in the movie.  Every other character could have been played by anyone, the mom especially lacked presence in the film with the exception of the scene in which she forcibly takes money from her son.  Not a bad movie, but it left much to be desired.  The music and cinematography were strong, but total lack of likeable characters, and odd character choices felt like it detracted from the any real entertainment value that could have been found here. The biggest problem was the main characters arc, troubled gay kid in broken home beats the **** out of bully, disappears, comes back as a drug peddler.  In the interim has not touched another person man or women, comes back and I guess gets back with his childhood hand jibber giver for love ever after?

It is not a ‘Gay’ and/or ‘Black’movie meant only for a minority as it gets into the many feelings all human beings go through.Chiron (Alex Hibbart as the 9 year old, Ashton Sanders, the teenager and Trevante Rhodes as the adult) goes from being an alienated, bullied boy to a muscled drug dealer who nobody fools with and in a way has followed the path of his mentor and surrogate father, Juan (Mahershala Ali), who taught the kid how to swim and discover himself.We also meet his friend Kevin (played at the three same stages as Chiron by Jadin Piner, Jharrel Jerome and Andre Holland), his mother (Naomie Harris) and Juan’s girlfriend (Janelle Monae) who offers Chiron a place to stay whenever he needs one.Chiron, as many gay kids, of any color, becomes a loner, is beaten up by schoolmates and accepts whatever kindness he receives. It was interesting following his path and where it goes. The scene in the diner is a love story unto itself though nothing is said about love except for a record playing on the jukebox.The film failed me in that certain sections the jargon, vernacular, made it difficult for me to hear what was being said though I understood what was being done just as I didn’t quite understand the relationship between Juan and Chiron and how it became about and took the turn it did. Also a few very interesting characters just disappear from the film. I wasn’t aware the N word was used so much between Blacks as it is here at a certain level.All 3 actors playing Chiron are outstanding as is the oldest Kevin. The arch of Chiron’s life holds your interest though at times moves too slowly. Ali’s Juan is an imposing figure and the two women, Harris and Monae, especially the former are strong in their portrayals. The direction and screenplay by Barry Jenkins, based on his life, tackles a rarely told story in the movies but it is also about loneliness and trying to answer the question “Who am I?”  Some scenes are held too long, others don’t finish the thoughts being expressed. There are two powerful scenes I don’t think I will forget though they may go over the heads of others.I do recommend “Moonlight” but don’t go in with high expectations as I did and approach it as going to see a good film with a new story.… Expand\\n',\n",

Both show a main character grow up and undergo otherwise mundane experiences, but those experiences are things that leave an indelible mark on him for the rest of his life. Moonlight, however, is different in scope. It is a journey of self-discovery undertaken by a man who is decidedly \"other\". He is black and living in the inner city with a drug addict mother and a drug dealing man who looks after him a bit. He is - as he will discover - gay. This is tough as a whole, but especially in the hypermasculine environment in which he lives. For Chiron, life is a minefield and one he must navigate or simply be consumed by it, all while figuring out who he is and what he wants.Barry Jenkins\\' film gracefully slides through Miami with Chiron and his life, while properly giving weight to each significant moment in his life. Jenkins let\\'s the camera linger, while Chiron - never much of a talker - rarely ever says anything. This allows the moment to really land on the audience, which makes Moonlight a film that is entirely heartbreaking. From a bullied youngster who first experiences being called a **** to a teen who has his first gay experience while finally fighting back against the bullies to an adult who has become everything he once stood against, Moonlight is an enriching and tragic film.However, Moonlight is equally a look at the black experience in America, particularly in the inner city. Chiron\\'s father is gone. His mother, Paula (Naomie Harris), is a drug addict. The only people who show him any love are Juan (Mahershala Ali) and his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae). However, Juan is a drug dealer and sells to Chiron\\'s mother. Clearly, his life is far from neat. When introducing his sexuality, his relationship with Kevin is all the more complicated by both\\'s need to display masculinity on the outside, which leads to them physically hurting one another often. There is a connection between them - highlighted by the brilliant acting of both\\'s final version, Trevante Rhodes as Chiron and Andre Holland as Kevin - but it is not one that can be explored due to the barriers between them. The look Kevin gives Chiron reveals all you need to know about how they feel about one another. Yet, it is hardly an option for either due to the need to look tough.In all areas, Jenkins\\' script is phenomenal. Truly nuanced character development, which allows all characters to show growth and a variety of dimensions and faces they show to the world. However, one of the greatest accomplishments is Juan. Mahershala Ali is being mentioned for an Oscar nomination and he certainly deserves one, but the writing is equally good. A sensitive, yet hard nosed drug dealer, Juan helps out Chiron whenever his mom kicks him out. He defends him and opens his home to him, while acting as a father figure for this lost child. Yet, he is a drug dealer. In reality, Juan is a foreshadowing of what Chiron will become. This is incredibly tragic and certainly something Chiron is aware of by the end. He knows his life is not built to last due to dealing drugs, but he is there because he never knew who he was and could never figure it out, because of his own thoughts on how a black man from the inner city should act. Juan reveals a lot of this, merely through his interactions with a young Chiron, especially his solemn regret when Chiron calls him out for selling drugs to Chiron\\'s mother. The similarities between the two (the doo-rag, the poor relationship with their mother, drug dealing, etc.) are numerous and often quite subtle. However, it reveals their connection and why they were drawn to one another.Moonlight is also beautifully shot, essentially relying upon the light of the moon to give sequences at night this sort of magical glow. Each scene at night is obviously quite dark, but the faces of the actors are glistened with this sort of hazy glow that really defines the look of this film. And what a look it is. Moonlight is a beautifully shot film with tremendous lighting and this beauty equally matches the beauty of its journey.A tale of self-discovery and losing yourself to your environment, Moonlight is a moving and tragic film that will stick in your mind for weeks to come. All of the acting is tremendous and to pick a standout performance would be far too difficult.

The story is told by chapters, portraying the protagonist in three moments of his life, as he grows up. The plot is simple, little actions but center on its characters. As Chiron interacts with his mom, a couple of strangers that welcomes him and his school friend, the viewer discover the theme of the film, the search for identity as a whole,  understanding of one’s emotions, clearing the brainstorm of thoughts in order to comprehend who you really are. The thing is that all these are endangered by a sexual identity that it’s still developing, so the outcome is very unique and beautiful on its way. The direction is precise, the screenplay cunningly fragmented, accurate score, the three actors that created the protagonist nailed it, but all the credits are for Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali, both gave sublime performances.

Sofre bullying na escola e, apesar de novo, é uma criança completamente independente. Com várias dúvidas a respeito de sua sexualidade, um dia ele sai de casa e, ao fugir das crianças que o maltratavam, ele conhece Juan (Mahershala Ali). Juan o ensina a ser uma boa pessoa, o encontrando escondido diversas vezes e lhe dando diversos conselhos. O menino, que mal consegue falar mais de 10 palavras, cresce dividido em uma família que não é a sua de verdade e com sua mãe, que por causa das drogas não lhe dá a devida atenção e diversas vezes mostra não se importar muito com o filho se preocupando apenas em conseguir dinheiro para comprar mais drogas.Ele tem uma amizade muito forte com Kevin, um garoto do qual ele começa a perceber um sentimento diferente e começa a se questionar.\\xa0Resumidamente, é sobre isso do que se trata o filme. Ouvi e li muitas críticas negativas pois pessoas conservadoras não gostaram do que viram, pois se sentiram incomodadas.\\xa0Agora eu pergunto, incomodadas com o que? Por se tratar de um filme que mostra o amor de verdade entre dois homens negros?Uma historia emocionante que nos mostra a construção completa do personagem Chiron (criança, adolescente e adulto) nos mostrando diversas vezes o preconceito das pessoas em relação aos homossexuais.O filme também nos mostra também a desconstrução da mãe, Paula (Naomie Harris) que com o tempo começa a se sentir culpada por tudo o que fez pelo filho, alegando que Teresa (Janelle Morae - esposa de Juan) lhe educou melhor justificando que Chiron passava mais tempo com a outra família do que em casa e que, muitas vezes, preferia conversar com Teresa do que com sua própria mãe.A relação de Kevin e Chiron foi bem construída do começo do filme até o final, te fazendo criar não só apego pelos personagens mas também se emocionando junto com Chiron. Assistir a este filme e não se sentir, nem que seja um pouco, comovido com todo o sofrimento que Chiron passou, algo está bem errado.Não vamos entrar aqui com questões religiosas e/ou sobre pessoas conservadoras. O preconceito vai acabar quando as pessoas olharem isso e acharem 'normal'. Observarem que o filme inteiro foi feito com atores excelentes, com um roteiro que te prende do começo ao fim e uma direção de arte impecável.\\xa0Moonlight ganhou o oscar de melhor ator coadjuvante (Mahershala Ali) que, em minha opinião, poderia sim ter aparecido mais algumas vezes durante o filme. Também ganhou melhor roteiro adaptado e melhor filme.\\xa0Foi merecido ter ganho o oscar de melhor filme. Não seria justo um filme como esse não ter ganho. É uma crítica social feita por negros. Uma história que acontece todos os dias com várias pessoas. É um aviso de que, infelizmente vivemos em um mundo preconceituoso e racista.\\xa0Pessoas conservadoras e religiosas deveriam sim ver esse filme.Deveriam sim observar como a maldade do ser humano pode destruir a vida de uma pessoa.Não sou crítica.

Many of the character relationships make little to no sense based on what is occurring in the movie.  This is a dark coming of age tale, but loses much of it's believability early on in the movie.  To start, the bullies of the movie recognize the main character as gay long before he himself does, almost making it seem as though because they call him gay he then turns gay. It is hard to care overmuch about the main character as he has maybe 25 lines in the entire movie, and anytime he does talk it's 4-5 word sentences followed by long stretches of silence. I guess this was supposed to be an interesting character trait, but when the movie contains nothing but dialog and the main character doesn't talk it seems like a bit of a problem. It's exacerbated by the fact that every other character in the movie constantly points it out. The best friend/lover is equally confusing throughout the movie.  His sexuality is seemingly fluid ranging from dude bro misogyny to handjibbers at the beach.  At least the friend/lover was charismatic and for me the only redeeming actor in the movie.  Every other character could have been played by anyone, the mom especially lacked presence in the film with the exception of the scene in which she forcibly takes money from her son.  Not a bad movie, but it left much to be desired.  The music and cinematography were strong, but total lack of likeable characters, and odd character choices felt like it detracted from the any real entertainment value that could have been found here. The biggest problem was the main characters arc, troubled gay kid in broken home beats the **** out of bully, disappears, comes back as a drug peddler.  In the interim has not touched another person man or women, comes back and I guess gets back with his childhood hand jibber giver for love ever after?

It is not a ‘Gay’ and/or ‘Black’movie meant only for a minority as it gets into the many feelings all human beings go through.Chiron (Alex Hibbart as the 9 year old, Ashton Sanders, the teenager and Trevante Rhodes as the adult) goes from being an alienated, bullied boy to a muscled drug dealer who nobody fools with and in a way has followed the path of his mentor and surrogate father, Juan (Mahershala Ali), who taught the kid how to swim and discover himself.We also meet his friend Kevin (played at the three same stages as Chiron by Jadin Piner, Jharrel Jerome and Andre Holland), his mother (Naomie Harris) and Juan’s girlfriend (Janelle Monae) who offers Chiron a place to stay whenever he needs one.Chiron, as many gay kids, of any color, becomes a loner, is beaten up by schoolmates and accepts whatever kindness he receives. It was interesting following his path and where it goes. The scene in the diner is a love story unto itself though nothing is said about love except for a record playing on the jukebox.The film failed me in that certain sections the jargon, vernacular, made it difficult for me to hear what was being said though I understood what was being done just as I didn’t quite understand the relationship between Juan and Chiron and how it became about and took the turn it did. Also a few very interesting characters just disappear from the film. I wasn’t aware the N word was used so much between Blacks as it is here at a certain level.All 3 actors playing Chiron are outstanding as is the oldest Kevin. The arch of Chiron’s life holds your interest though at times moves too slowly. Ali’s Juan is an imposing figure and the two women, Harris and Monae, especially the former are strong in their portrayals. The direction and screenplay by Barry Jenkins, based on his life, tackles a rarely told story in the movies but it is also about loneliness and trying to answer the question “Who am I?”  Some scenes are held too long, others don’t finish the thoughts being expressed. There are two powerful scenes I don’t think I will forget though they may go over the heads of others.I do recommend “Moonlight” but don’t go in with high expectations as I did and approach it as going to see a good film with a new story.… Expand',\n",

Both show a main character grow up and undergo otherwise mundane experiences, but those experiences are things that leave an indelible mark on him for the rest of his life. Moonlight, however, is different in scope. It is a journey of self-discovery undertaken by a man who is decidedly \"other\". He is black and living in the inner city with a drug addict mother and a drug dealing man who looks after him a bit. He is - as he will discover - gay. This is tough as a whole, but especially in the hypermasculine environment in which he lives. For Chiron, life is a minefield and one he must navigate or simply be consumed by it, all while figuring out who he is and what he wants.Barry Jenkins\\' film gracefully slides through Miami with Chiron and his life, while properly giving weight to each significant moment in his life. Jenkins let\\'s the camera linger, while Chiron - never much of a talker - rarely ever says anything. This allows the moment to really land on the audience, which makes Moonlight a film that is entirely heartbreaking. From a bullied youngster who first experiences being called a **** to a teen who has his first gay experience while finally fighting back against the bullies to an adult who has become everything he once stood against, Moonlight is an enriching and tragic film.However, Moonlight is equally a look at the black experience in America, particularly in the inner city. Chiron\\'s father is gone. His mother, Paula (Naomie Harris), is a drug addict. The only people who show him any love are Juan (Mahershala Ali) and his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae). However, Juan is a drug dealer and sells to Chiron\\'s mother. Clearly, his life is far from neat. When introducing his sexuality, his relationship with Kevin is all the more complicated by both\\'s need to display masculinity on the outside, which leads to them physically hurting one another often. There is a connection between them - highlighted by the brilliant acting of both\\'s final version, Trevante Rhodes as Chiron and Andre Holland as Kevin - but it is not one that can be explored due to the barriers between them. The look Kevin gives Chiron reveals all you need to know about how they feel about one another. Yet, it is hardly an option for either due to the need to look tough.In all areas, Jenkins\\' script is phenomenal. Truly nuanced character development, which allows all characters to show growth and a variety of dimensions and faces they show to the world. However, one of the greatest accomplishments is Juan. Mahershala Ali is being mentioned for an Oscar nomination and he certainly deserves one, but the writing is equally good. A sensitive, yet hard nosed drug dealer, Juan helps out Chiron whenever his mom kicks him out. He defends him and opens his home to him, while acting as a father figure for this lost child. Yet, he is a drug dealer. In reality, Juan is a foreshadowing of what Chiron will become. This is incredibly tragic and certainly something Chiron is aware of by the end. He knows his life is not built to last due to dealing drugs, but he is there because he never knew who he was and could never figure it out, because of his own thoughts on how a black man from the inner city should act. Juan reveals a lot of this, merely through his interactions with a young Chiron, especially his solemn regret when Chiron calls him out for selling drugs to Chiron\\'s mother. The similarities between the two (the doo-rag, the poor relationship with their mother, drug dealing, etc.) are numerous and often quite subtle. However, it reveals their connection and why they were drawn to one another.Moonlight is also beautifully shot, essentially relying upon the light of the moon to give sequences at night this sort of magical glow. Each scene at night is obviously quite dark, but the faces of the actors are glistened with this sort of hazy glow that really defines the look of this film. And what a look it is. Moonlight is a beautifully shot film with tremendous lighting and this beauty equally matches the beauty of its journey.A tale of self-discovery and losing yourself to your environment, Moonlight is a moving and tragic film that will stick in your mind for weeks to come. All of the acting is tremendous and to pick a standout performance would be far too difficult. Every actor brought an authentic quality to their role, which is fantastic to see given the tremendously written characters.… Expand',\n",

Com várias dúvidas a respeito de sua sexualidade, um dia ele sai de casaChiron é uma criança negra, classe baixa e que mora com uma mãe viciada em drogas. Sofre bullying na escola e, apesar de novo, é uma criança completamente independente. Com várias dúvidas a respeito de sua sexualidade, um dia ele sai de casa e, ao fugir das crianças que o maltratavam, ele conhece Juan (Mahershala Ali). Juan o ensina a ser uma boa pessoa, o encontrando escondido diversas vezes e lhe dando diversos conselhos. O menino, que mal consegue falar mais de 10 palavras, cresce dividido em uma família que não é a sua de verdade e com sua mãe, que por causa das drogas não lhe dá a devida atenção e diversas vezes mostra não se importar muito com o filho se preocupando apenas em conseguir dinheiro para comprar mais drogas.Ele tem uma amizade muito forte com Kevin, um garoto do qual ele começa a perceber um sentimento diferente e começa a se questionar.\\xa0Resumidamente, é sobre isso do que se trata o filme. Ouvi e li muitas críticas negativas pois pessoas conservadoras não gostaram do que viram, pois se sentiram incomodadas.\\xa0Agora eu pergunto, incomodadas com o que? Por se tratar de um filme que mostra o amor de verdade entre dois homens negros?Uma historia emocionante que nos mostra a construção completa do personagem Chiron (criança, adolescente e adulto) nos mostrando diversas vezes o preconceito das pessoas em relação aos homossexuais.O filme também nos mostra também a desconstrução da mãe, Paula (Naomie Harris) que com o tempo começa a se sentir culpada por tudo o que fez pelo filho, alegando que Teresa (Janelle Morae - esposa de Juan) lhe educou melhor justificando que Chiron passava mais tempo com a outra família do que em casa e que, muitas vezes, preferia conversar com Teresa do que com sua própria mãe.A relação de Kevin e Chiron foi bem construída do começo do filme até o final, te fazendo criar não só apego pelos personagens mas também se emocionando junto com Chiron. Assistir a este filme e não se sentir, nem que seja um pouco, comovido com todo o sofrimento que Chiron passou, algo está bem errado.Não vamos entrar aqui com questões religiosas e/ou sobre pessoas conservadoras. O preconceito vai acabar quando as pessoas olharem isso e acharem 'normal'. Observarem que o filme inteiro foi feito com atores excelentes, com um roteiro que te prende do começo ao fim e uma direção de arte impecável.\\xa0Moonlight ganhou o oscar de melhor ator coadjuvante (Mahershala Ali) que, em minha opinião, poderia sim ter aparecido mais algumas vezes durante o filme. Também ganhou melhor roteiro adaptado e melhor filme.\\xa0Foi merecido ter ganho o oscar de melhor filme. Não seria justo um filme como esse não ter ganho. É uma crítica social feita por negros. Uma história que acontece todos os dias com várias pessoas. É um aviso de que, infelizmente vivemos em um mundo preconceituoso e racista.\\xa0Pessoas conservadoras e religiosas deveriam sim ver esse filme.Deveriam sim observar como a maldade do ser humano pode destruir a vida de uma pessoa.Não sou crítica. Faço isso apenas por diversão. Mas Moonlight foi um dos melhores filmes de 2016 e não tem como negar isso.Estou aplaudindo de pé Barry Jenkins.… Expand\",\n",

When people ask me “What was the best film of the year?” I say Moonlight. This is a dark, gritty story that felt like it wasn’t being told because anyone decided to tell it, but more like fate had been leading Barry Jenkins and company towards this their whole lives. The obvious comparison would be Boyhood, and it feels that grand in scope, but more timely. If you had told me that they filmed all of the iterations of the main character, Chiron, over a twenty year span with the same actor, I would have believed you. However, if there is one thing I will remember from Moonlight down the line (because it is a little heavy for a regular spot in the rotation), it will be Mahershala Ali. I loved Dev Patel’s performance in Lion, and in many ways it was more athletic, but I would have turned off the Academy Awards after the first card had Ali not won. The scene at the dinner table could have been his only scene in the movie, and he would have earned that Oscar. That is all. 9.2/10… Expand',\n",

What is mesmerizing is seeing three different actors playing the same character at three different ages and fully believing that it is the same person though the character changes so greatly. We see the root of certain characteristics in the boy that eventually blossoms in the adult version of the man. It's a testament to Barry Jenkins' attention to detail and his ability to work with actors and elicit honest and moving portrayals. A quietly moving and occasionally stark film that packs powerhouse moments and an aching beauty that courses through every frame. I highly recommend this one and for fans of Wong Kar Wai, there are a few stylistic and visual homages to the great Hong Kong director.… Expand\",\n",

Many of the character relationships make little to no sense based on what is occurring in the movie.  This is a dark coming of age tale, but loses much of it's believability early on in the movie.  To start, the bullies of the movie recognize the main character as gay long before he himself does, almost making it seem as though because they call him gay he then turns gay. It is hard to care overmuch about the main character as he has maybe 25 lines in the entire movie, and anytime he does talk it's 4-5 word sentences followed by long stretches of silence. I guess this was supposed to be an interesting character trait, but when the movie contains nothing but dialog and the main character doesn't talk it seems like a bit of a problem. It's exacerbated by the fact that every other character in the movie constantly points it out. The best friend/lover is equally confusing throughout the movie.  His sexuality is seemingly fluid ranging from dude bro misogyny to handjibbers at the beach.  At least the friend/lover was charismatic and for me the only redeeming actor in the movie.  Every other character could have been played by anyone, the mom especially lacked presence in the film with the exception of the scene in which she forcibly takes money from her son.  Not a bad movie, but it left much to be desired.  The music and cinematography were strong, but total lack of likeable characters, and odd character choices felt like it detracted from the any real entertainment value that could have been found here. The biggest problem was the main characters arc, troubled gay kid in broken home beats the **** out of bully, disappears, comes back as a drug peddler.  In the interim has not touched another person man or women, comes back and I guess gets back with his childhood hand jibber giver for love ever after?

It is not a ‘Gay’ and/or ‘Black’movie meant only for a minority as it gets into the many feelings all human beings go through.Chiron (Alex Hibbart as the 9 year old, Ashton Sanders, the teenager and Trevante Rhodes as the adult) goes from being an alienated, bullied boy to a muscled drug dealer who nobody fools with and in a way has followed the path of his mentor and surrogate father, Juan (Mahershala Ali), who taught the kid how to swim and discover himself.We also meet his friend Kevin (played at the three same stages as Chiron by Jadin Piner, Jharrel Jerome and Andre Holland), his mother (Naomie Harris) and Juan’s girlfriend (Janelle Monae) who offers Chiron a place to stay whenever he needs one.Chiron, as many gay kids, of any color, becomes a loner, is beaten up by schoolmates and accepts whatever kindness he receives. It was interesting following his path and where it goes. The scene in the diner is a love story unto itself though nothing is said about love except for a record playing on the jukebox.The film failed me in that certain sections the jargon, vernacular, made it difficult for me to hear what was being said though I understood what was being done just as I didn’t quite understand the relationship between Juan and Chiron and how it became about and took the turn it did. Also a few very interesting characters just disappear from the film. I wasn’t aware the N word was used so much between Blacks as it is here at a certain level.All 3 actors playing Chiron are outstanding as is the oldest Kevin. The arch of Chiron’s life holds your interest though at times moves too slowly. Ali’s Juan is an imposing figure and the two women, Harris and Monae, especially the former are strong in their portrayals. The direction and screenplay by Barry Jenkins, based on his life, tackles a rarely told story in the movies but it is also about loneliness and trying to answer the question “Who am I?”  Some scenes are held too long, others don’t finish the thoughts being expressed. There are two powerful scenes I don’t think I will forget though they may go over the heads of others.I do recommend “Moonlight” but don’t go in with high expectations as I did and approach it as going to see a good film with a new story.… Expand',\n",

Both show a main character grow up and undergo otherwise mundane experiences, but those experiences are things that leave an indelible mark on him for the rest of his life. Moonlight, however, is different in scope. It is a journey of self-discovery undertaken by a man who is decidedly \"other\". He is black and living in the inner city with a drug addict mother and a drug dealing man who looks after him a bit. He is - as he will discover - gay. This is tough as a whole, but especially in the hypermasculine environment in which he lives. For Chiron, life is a minefield and one he must navigate or simply be consumed by it, all while figuring out who he is and what he wants.Barry Jenkins\\' film gracefully slides through Miami with Chiron and his life, while properly giving weight to each significant moment in his life. Jenkins let\\'s the camera linger, while Chiron - never much of a talker - rarely ever says anything. This allows the moment to really land on the audience, which makes Moonlight a film that is entirely heartbreaking. From a bullied youngster who first experiences being called a **** to a teen who has his first gay experience while finally fighting back against the bullies to an adult who has become everything he once stood against, Moonlight is an enriching and tragic film.However, Moonlight is equally a look at the black experience in America, particularly in the inner city. Chiron\\'s father is gone. His mother, Paula (Naomie Harris), is a drug addict. The only people who show him any love are Juan (Mahershala Ali) and his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae). However, Juan is a drug dealer and sells to Chiron\\'s mother. Clearly, his life is far from neat. When introducing his sexuality, his relationship with Kevin is all the more complicated by both\\'s need to display masculinity on the outside, which leads to them physically hurting one another often. There is a connection between them - highlighted by the brilliant acting of both\\'s final version, Trevante Rhodes as Chiron and Andre Holland as Kevin - but it is not one that can be explored due to the barriers between them. The look Kevin gives Chiron reveals all you need to know about how they feel about one another. Yet, it is hardly an option for either due to the need to look tough.In all areas, Jenkins\\' script is phenomenal. Truly nuanced character development, which allows all characters to show growth and a variety of dimensions and faces they show to the world. However, one of the greatest accomplishments is Juan. Mahershala Ali is being mentioned for an Oscar nomination and he certainly deserves one, but the writing is equally good. A sensitive, yet hard nosed drug dealer, Juan helps out Chiron whenever his mom kicks him out. He defends him and opens his home to him, while acting as a father figure for this lost child. Yet, he is a drug dealer. In reality, Juan is a foreshadowing of what Chiron will become. This is incredibly tragic and certainly something Chiron is aware of by the end. He knows his life is not built to last due to dealing drugs, but he is there because he never knew who he was and could never figure it out, because of his own thoughts on how a black man from the inner city should act. Juan reveals a lot of this, merely through his interactions with a young Chiron, especially his solemn regret when Chiron calls him out for selling drugs to Chiron\\'s mother. The similarities between the two (the doo-rag, the poor relationship with their mother, drug dealing, etc.) are numerous and often quite subtle. However, it reveals their connection and why they were drawn to one another.Moonlight is also beautifully shot, essentially relying upon the light of the moon to give sequences at night this sort of magical glow. Each scene at night is obviously quite dark, but the faces of the actors are glistened with this sort of hazy glow that really defines the look of this film. And what a look it is. Moonlight is a beautifully shot film with tremendous lighting and this beauty equally matches the beauty of its journey.A tale of self-discovery and losing yourself to your environment, Moonlight is a moving and tragic film that will stick in your mind for weeks to come. All of the acting is tremendous and to pick a standout performance would be far too difficult. Every actor brought an authentic quality to their role, which is fantastic to see given the tremendously written characters.… Expand',\n",

Most importantly realistic narrative.More like it is about the life cycle. Feels like a short and suburban version of 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring'. All the actors were so good. The screenplay was adapted from a book. Looks like it's a breakthrough for the director. I hope he keeps up the momentum and gives us the best products in the future. This film is not for everyone, mainly because of the theme. Initial parts were okay, but the latter developments were unexpected. It is one of the good films of the year, not the best.7/10… Expand\",\n",

Com várias dúvidas a respeito de sua sexualidade, um dia ele sai de casaChiron é uma criança negra, classe baixa e que mora com uma mãe viciada em drogas. Sofre bullying na escola e, apesar de novo, é uma criança completamente independente. Com várias dúvidas a respeito de sua sexualidade, um dia ele sai de casa e, ao fugir das crianças que o maltratavam, ele conhece Juan (Mahershala Ali). Juan o ensina a ser uma boa pessoa, o encontrando escondido diversas vezes e lhe dando diversos conselhos. O menino, que mal consegue falar mais de 10 palavras, cresce dividido em uma família que não é a sua de verdade e com sua mãe, que por causa das drogas não lhe dá a devida atenção e diversas vezes mostra não se importar muito com o filho se preocupando apenas em conseguir dinheiro para comprar mais drogas.Ele tem uma amizade muito forte com Kevin, um garoto do qual ele começa a perceber um sentimento diferente e começa a se questionar.\\xa0Resumidamente, é sobre isso do que se trata o filme. Ouvi e li muitas críticas negativas pois pessoas conservadoras não gostaram do que viram, pois se sentiram incomodadas.\\xa0Agora eu pergunto, incomodadas com o que? Por se tratar de um filme que mostra o amor de verdade entre dois homens negros?Uma historia emocionante que nos mostra a construção completa do personagem Chiron (criança, adolescente e adulto) nos mostrando diversas vezes o preconceito das pessoas em relação aos homossexuais.O filme também nos mostra também a desconstrução da mãe, Paula (Naomie Harris) que com o tempo começa a se sentir culpada por tudo o que fez pelo filho, alegando que Teresa (Janelle Morae - esposa de Juan) lhe educou melhor justificando que Chiron passava mais tempo com a outra família do que em casa e que, muitas vezes, preferia conversar com Teresa do que com sua própria mãe.A relação de Kevin e Chiron foi bem construída do começo do filme até o final, te fazendo criar não só apego pelos personagens mas também se emocionando junto com Chiron. Assistir a este filme e não se sentir, nem que seja um pouco, comovido com todo o sofrimento que Chiron passou, algo está bem errado.Não vamos entrar aqui com questões religiosas e/ou sobre pessoas conservadoras. O preconceito vai acabar quando as pessoas olharem isso e acharem 'normal'. Observarem que o filme inteiro foi feito com atores excelentes, com um roteiro que te prende do começo ao fim e uma direção de arte impecável.\\xa0Moonlight ganhou o oscar de melhor ator coadjuvante (Mahershala Ali) que, em minha opinião, poderia sim ter aparecido mais algumas vezes durante o filme. Também ganhou melhor roteiro adaptado e melhor filme.\\xa0Foi merecido ter ganho o oscar de melhor filme. Não seria justo um filme como esse não ter ganho. É uma crítica social feita por negros. Uma história que acontece todos os dias com várias pessoas. É um aviso de que, infelizmente vivemos em um mundo preconceituoso e racista.\\xa0Pessoas conservadoras e religiosas deveriam sim ver esse filme.Deveriam sim observar como a maldade do ser humano pode destruir a vida de uma pessoa.Não sou crítica. Faço isso apenas por diversão. Mas Moonlight foi um dos melhores filmes de 2016 e não tem como negar isso.Estou aplaudindo de pé Barry Jenkins.… Expand\",\n",

When people ask me “What was the best film of the year?” I say Moonlight. This is a dark, gritty story that felt like it wasn’t being told because anyone decided to tell it, but more like fate had been leading Barry Jenkins and company towards this their whole lives. The obvious comparison would be Boyhood, and it feels that grand in scope, but more timely. If you had told me that they filmed all of the iterations of the main character, Chiron, over a twenty year span with the same actor, I would have believed you. However, if there is one thing I will remember from Moonlight down the line (because it is a little heavy for a regular spot in the rotation), it will be Mahershala Ali. I loved Dev Patel’s performance in Lion, and in many ways it was more athletic, but I would have turned off the Academy Awards after the first card had Ali not won.

What is mesmerizing is seeing three different actors playing the same character at three different ages and fully believing that it is the same person though the character changes so greatly. We see the root of certain characteristics in the boy that eventually blossoms in the adult version of the man. It's a testament to Barry Jenkins' attention to detail and his ability to work with actors and elicit honest and moving portrayals. A quietly moving and occasionally stark film that packs powerhouse moments and an aching beauty that courses through every frame.
